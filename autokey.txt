Dear Sir

Any text between the top and bottom parentheses is treated literally, including commas and percent signs.
By default, the hard carriage return (Enter) between the previous line and this one is also preserved.
    By default, the indentation (tab) to the left of this line is preserved.

All of this text can be input to the email without worrying about the length of the text or any other problems.  The text I am currently inputting is way longer than any line in the Notepad file can cope with, in other words it gets to the end of the line and wraps itself. At least that is the theory but it seems to go on for ever and never actually gets to the end of the line.

See continuation section for how to change these default behaviors.
