virutual machine:
bare metal
type:1             DC->ESXI
                  |
      vsphere- ESXI->20 gb

exsi(VM)              PHYSICAL->bare metal
tyoe2 w.s
os
h/w

esxi- 20 gb of ram :in old days-static allocation(it allocates dynamically)

physical


fault tolerance:within esxi also we use do fault tolerance.
advanage -more functionality it will become more vunerability
if one server goes down another one can be replaced.


it can reused it.os can be moved from one place to another.
moving virutulization  will stored in data center. and moved into another esxi



type 2:
os  os     os
|   |      |
hypervisor.type 
os
hardware


eg:vmbox,hypervisor

two types:
 
ovf-open virtulization format
ova-open virtulization appliance

metadata files sAVE IN .OVF
.ISO-
.OVF 


create a three virutulization machine ram os should be same.
clone a virutal machine.-same copy




esxi
vsphere client:
install windows server
on top that install vsphere
1.reduce ram of exsi:-


add host

give ip address
give root 
give password
c

vsphere clients
exsi
vcenter server we connect to vsphere clients
vsphere web client

two ways to connect with vcenter.
vsphere client installed in windows machine
vsphere web client -come with vcenter 
vcenter is more powerful


we have esxi server....vsphere client,vcenter server,vpshere web client.
